/**
 * Represents a filter that determines at what location a {@link BlockRay} should stop. This filter
 * is called at the boundary of each new location that a {@link BlockRay} passes through in order
 * to determine whether the ray cast should continue or terminate at that location.
 *
 * <p>Any one instance of a {@link BlockRayFilter} should only be run on one path, meaning that the
 * {@link #start(Location, Vector3d)} method should only be called once. It is not specified that
 * {@link BlockRayFilter}s have to be stateless, pure functions. They are allowed to keep state
 * along an individual path, based on the assertion that a single instance is only called on one
 * path.</p>
 *
 * <p>{@link BlockRayFilter}s are most useful for limiting the target block a player is looking
 * at based on some metric, like transparency, block model, or even distance. The standard
 * Bukkit-like behavior for finding the target block can be achieved with using
 * {@link BlockRayFilter#ONLY_AIR}, optionally combined with
 * {@link BlockRayFilter#maxDistance(int)} to limit the target block to be within some
 * distance.</p>
 *
 * <p>A {@link BlockRayFilter} is modeled as a predicate taking three doubles and a block face,
 * (in the {@link #shouldContinue(double, double, double, Direction)} method) instead of using a
 * regular {@link com.google.common.base.Predicate} taking a tuple. This is to save object
 * creation, which can become very expensive if an individual ray cast goes through hundreds or
 * thousands of locations.</p>
 *
 * <p>Many {@link BlockRayFilter}s are not concerned with the individual positions within a block.
 * For convenience, a {@link DiscreteBlockRayFilter} class is provided that wraps
 * {@link BlockRayFilter}s that only care about discrete block locations.</p>
